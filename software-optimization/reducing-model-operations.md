  * Using MACs\(multiply-accumulate operations\) as a performance metric
* How to use efficient layers in our model
  * Separable Convolutions

## FLOPs vs. FLOPS {#flops-vs-flops}

Hardware devices are typically rated for the number of Floating Point Operations \(FLOPs\) they can perform in a _second_.

> This is referred to as **F**loating **P**oint **O**perations per **S**econd or **FLOPS**.

It is easy to get _FLOPs_\(with a lower-case "s"\) confused with _FLOPS_\(with a capital "S"\).

**FLOPs **stands for \_floating-point operations \_and refers to a **quantity**.

**FLOPS **stands for \_floating-point operations \_and refers to a **rate**.

For example, if we say "100 FLOPs", we are simply referring to the number of operationsâ€”whereas if we say, "100 FLOPS", this is referring to the number of operations a model performs in a second.
