## Why Optimize? {#why-optimize-}

Remember, two common reasons for doing software optimization are:

1. To get better performance without changing the existing design or hardware
2. To use less system resources, in order to free them up for another application running on the same hardware

## Course Outline {#course-outline}

We'll be covering a wide range of tools and concepts that can help us achieve these optimization goals. Here's the outline we went over in the video, just for your reference:

* Performance Metrics
* Reducing Model Operations
  * Calculating Model Complexity
  * Using Efficient Layers
  * Comparing Layerwise Performance
  * Model Pruning
* Reducing Model Size
  * Quantization
  * Quantizing using DL Workbench
  * Model Compression
  * Knowledge Distillation
* Other Optimization Techniques
  * VTune Amplifier
  * Packaging your Application

## What You'll Build {#what-you-ll-build}

At the end of the course, you'll have the opportunity to demonstrate your new optimization skills by building an application to control your computer mouse pointer using your eye gaze. You'll start with video input of a person looking at different locations on the screenâ€”either from your webcam or from a pre-recorded file that we'll provide. You'll then use multiple pre-trained models to track the eye movements and control the mouse pointer. The project will demonstrate your ability to work with multiple models in OpenVINO and your ability to benchmark and optimize your Inference Engine application.
