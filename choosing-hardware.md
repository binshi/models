As IoT devices become more common in our daily lives, an increasing number of industries—from advanced medical research and personalized healthcare to smart transportation and retail—are relying on video for critical insights and competitive growth. Traditionally, AI and Machine Learning algorithms have been run either on cloud servers or on desktop systems with add-in GPUs, but there is an increasing need to process data on local hardware devices.

Today, there are many different options for edge hardware. But which hardware should you choose? How can you know if a particular piece of hardware is the right one for a particular need? Since the costs of different pieces of hardware can vary widely, this is a critical question—and exactly the question we'll be tackling in this course.

we'll cover four main hardware types:

* CPU
* GPU
* VPU
* FPGA

We'll discuss not only the specifications for these hardware types, but also:

* How to figure out which devices are the best fit for your application.
* How to determine what hardware to use with the
  _OpenVino Toolkit_
  and match up the hardware,
  _inference model_
  , and the
  _inference rate_
  needed by your application.

Finally, we will introduce the[Intel DevCloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/)for the edge, where you can test your application on a large range of hardware, including various CPUs, GPUs, VPUs, and a FPGA. Using the DevCloud will allow you to determine which hardware types best fit your needs and budget.
